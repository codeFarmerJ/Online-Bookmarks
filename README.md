# Online Bookmarks

Online Bookmarks allows me to store and organize my bookmarks on 
myown server better than anything else I've found.  I've used it 
since 2004 but it recently broke after upgrading to PHP 7 which 
deprecated the MySQL database calls.  My of those have now been 
updated to PHP's PDO database calls.

## What works:
* basic bookmark add, delete, edit, move
* basic folder add, delete, edit, move
* search
* admin / user

## What needs improvement:
* more testing of everything
* export - formats are old
* import - formats are old

## What is not working yet:
* install script
* shared folders - maybe working?


## Possible future goals:
* validate URL is alive
